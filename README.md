## Shebang!

Why learning bash?
Bash has the power to automate things!

I was advised by one of my colleagues to look at a tutorial on YouTube.
I attempted to explain what I learned in this tutorial by commenting on the exercises.
Have a peek @ the exercises ;)

## What is Bash?

Bash stands for: - Bourne

			- Again

			- Shell

This is just a better version of the previous shell created in 1970.

It's the command line in linux and how we interact with the linux operating system.

The bash shell is just how we make Linux do things: make new files, add new users,...

The great thing about Bash is that we can write scripts to automate things.
